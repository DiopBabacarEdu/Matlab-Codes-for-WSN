# Matlab Codes for WSN Simulations

This repo contains several codes of simulating deployment in Wireless Sensor Networks,
with target points at static location and sensors around imagined as battery powererd devices deployed to guarantee complete 
coverage of targets, with the energy efficiency constraints.

These code have been developped under a phD thesis with title :
### Target coverage management in Wireless Sensor Networks.
It has been defended at Gaston Berger University, May 3rd 2019.
